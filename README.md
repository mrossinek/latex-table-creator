Welcome to the LaTeX Table Creator!


You will be able to create highly customizable
LaTeX tables from your raw data files. This will
save you a lot of typing time and produce equal
results throughout your whole work.

During the process you will have to provide your
raw data in an acceptable file format and will be
given a number of different choices to style and 
customize your tables accordingly.

I hope you enjoy this program. Please notify me
on any problems or bugs and do not hesitate to
make suggestions on new features you would like
to see in this program.


Happy TeXing!
